Usually, getting started with Virtualmin can be done with a few simple steps, using our automated install script. The install script will setup your package manager, usually `apt-get` or `dnf`, and then download our packages as well as all of the necessary dependencies for running Virtualmin.

{{< alert primary question "" "Never run the `virtualmin-install.sh` script to upgrade or renew or to try to repair an existing Virtualmin system! The `virtualmin change-license` command is used for license changes and renewals. [Check the license FAQ](/docs/faq/#license) for details." >}}

### Install your operating system
Start with a freshly installed, [Grade A supported OS](/docs/os-support/) on your server or VPS. Rocky Linux and Ubuntu LTS are very popular options for hosting, and are a safe choice, but any Grade A supported system should work fine. Be sure to configure your system with a [fully qualified domain name](/docs/installation/automated#fully-qualified-domain-name), as it will save you a lot of time and documentation spelunking later. Do not name your system the same name as a domain you'll be hosting in Virtualmin.

{{< alert warning exclamation-triangle "" "Do not pre-install or pre-configure any additional packages on your OS. The installer expects a freshly installed, supported OS, and anything you do differently may cause conflicts or configuration errors. The only exception is that if MySQL is preferred over MariaDB, it should be [installed before](/docs/installation/automated/#mysql-vs-mariadb) starting the installation. If you plan to enable third-party package repositories, do so after installing Virtualmin, and only with extreme caution." >}}

### Download and run install script
If you have already purchased a [Virtualmin Professional](/docs/professional-features/) license, you can find it in [My Account → Software Licenses](/account/account/). If not, you can purchase a license or download Virtualmin GPL.

The quickest way to initiate the installation of Virtualmin GPL on your server is to log in via SSH using a terminal, and execute the following pre-prepared command:

```
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/virtualmin-install.sh)" -- --bundle LAMP
```

{{< note "For Virtualmin Professional, use the command suggested on [My Account → Software Licenses](/account/) page." "Note:" "notification" >}}

### Install script options

There are some available options to install different configurations (including installing Nginx instead of Apache, and leaving out some of the mail processing stack for small memory systems). Run the install script with the `--help` flag for a list of available options, and consult the documentation, especially about the available [installation bundles](/docs/installation/automated#lamp-apache-vs-lemp-nginx) and the [minimal installation mode](/docs/installation/automated#full-install-vs-minimal-install), if choosing a non-default installation type.

The install script may ask you some questions.

If your system does not have a fully qualified hostname, the script will ask you to provide one. Do not use a name you will be hosting in Virtualmin. For example, if you are hosting `virtualmin.com` in Virtualmin, you could name your system `srv1.virtualmin.com` or `main.virtualmin.com`, but you should not name it `virtualmin.com`.

Or, if your system doesn't have enough memory for the installation type you've chosen, it'll offer to create a swap file. 

After a few minutes, your system should have everything it needs to provide a full-featured virtual web hosting environment! Now login to Virtualmin by browsing to port 10000 on the address of your server using the HTTPS protocol. Ignore the SSL certificate validation error (the SSL certificate is a self-signed one after initial installation, but can be replaced with a valid certificate after initial configuration is complete).

Follow the steps in the post-install wizard to setup Virtualmin to suit your environment and needs. Virtualmin will check the configuration of the system and validate some server settings to insure your system is ready for service.

### Check the documentation
If your particular deployment doesn't fit these simple steps, either because you cannot freshly install your OS, or you cannot use a Grade A supported OS, Virtualmin can probably still work for you. Check out the [installation documentation](/docs/installation/guides/), which covers a lot more detail about how a Virtualmin system is installed, and other ways to install it.
